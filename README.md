## International Green Gas House Emission Vs Energy Consumption

### Introduction :
This project is an attempt to study about Countries Green House Gas Emission and their Energy Statistics, which are part of [Paris Climate Agreement](https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-d&chapter=27&lang=en) . The motivation behind this study mainly came from the recent announcement of United State withdrawing from Paris Climate Agreement.

### Additional Resource / Publication :

There have been multiple research done across Energy Consumption and Green House Gas Emission but I was only able to find one research paper focused on Energy consumption vs Green House Gas Emission :
