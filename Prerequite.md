United Nations - National Accounts-Global GDP &amp; Government Expenditures since 1946 (https://www.kaggle.com/unitednations/national-accounts)

The repo should include:
● A Jupyter notebook that contains both your written report and your code
● Your data, or a sample of your data, that can be run in your notebook
● A short written abstract of your study that describes what you did, and what you found.
● An MIT LICENSE file for your code
●A README that contains
  a.Documentation and license information for your data, etc. (same basic reqs as A1 and A2)
  b.Hyperlinks to ALL relevant resources (TOS, API documentation, license deeds, etc)

  What the notebook should contain
  Your report will be written inside your Jupyter Notebook. You will need to properly document and describe your code at each step, and structure your report in a readable way.
  It is up to you whether you want to embed all the analysis code in the body of the report (example), or put the report first and the code after. Either way, every step in your data munging/analysis process needs to be documented in markdown cells, not inline comments.
  Clear section headings are required. Here’s one good way to structure your report:
  ●Introduction
  ●Background (or Related Work)
  ●Methods
  ●Findings
  ●Discussion (or Implications)
  ●Conclusion
  ●References


  ●Introduction: Why is this analysis interesting or important (to people besides you)? Does it solve a real problem or tackle an unresolved research question? ●Background/Related Work: What other research has been done in this area? How does this research inform your hypotheses, your analysis, or your system design? What are your hypotheses or research questions?●Methods: Not just your analytical methods: also, why you chose them, and how human-centered considerations such as ethics informed the way you designed your study. ●Findings: What did you find? Use words and figures, don’t just point to code.●Discussion/Implications: Limitations of your study (this is required!); Why what you found is important; How could future research build on this study?●Conclusion: Restate your research questions/hypotheses and summarize your findings; Explain to the reader how this study informs the their understanding of HCDS●References: Any publications (blogs, articles, research papers) you refer to in the text.
